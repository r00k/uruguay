Outline:

Intro
  Not a tutorial
  Going to focus on the stuff that's very different from Ruby
Syntax firehose
Interactive development
  REPL
  Fireplace
  Don't need spring since you can reload small bits
Immutability
  No more defensive copying
    .dup can .die
  GOTO quote
  We already know this
    Example 1
      Does anyone wish numbers were mutable?
      Imagine if 4.increment didn't return 5
    Example 2
      git
  What if we brought this beyond our code?
    Datomic
      Tree metaphor
      Query TAKES a database
      Even your query becomes immutable!
  Can use a little bit of this in Ruby
    Value objects
    Limiting mutation
    Record new data without obliterating old
Macros
  Use macroexpand
ClojureScript
  Client-side apps that don't suck to write
  Show source maps


Notes:
  Focus on just the differences from Ruby
    X Namespaces
    X Immutability
    X Macros
    STM
    Laziness
    Core.async
    Metadata
    Generative testing
    Datomic

Setup:
  Make sure that select-evens has bug
  Require! file
