Outline:

Intro
  Not a tutorial
  Will focus on differences
  Questions welcome!
Syntax firehose
Interactive development
  REPL
  Fireplace
  Don't need spring
  Can connect anywhere
Immutability
  Sharability
    No more defensive copying
      .dup can .die
  GOTO quote
  We already know this
    Example 1
      Does anyone wish numbers were mutable?
      Imagine if 4.increment didn't return 5
    Example 2
      git
  Can use a little bit of this in Ruby
    Value objects
    Limiting mutation
    Record new data without obliterating old
Reference types
  How do we represent change?
  Atoms
    Check-and-set
      Read, apply, try to set, retry
      No race conditions
      No mutexs/locks
  Refs
    STM
      Analogous to database transactions

Macros
  (cons
    (last expression)
    (butlast expression))
  Line in ruby between you and special
  Handful special, rest macro/fn
ClojureScript
  Client-side apps that don't suck to write
  Show source maps


Notes:
  Focus on just the differences from Ruby
    X Namespaces
    X Immutability
    X Macros
    STM
    Laziness
    Core.async
    Metadata
    Generative testing
    Datomic

Setup:
  Make sure that select-evens has bug
  Require! file
  Open shell to rails with ag command
